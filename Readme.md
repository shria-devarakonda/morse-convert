# Morse Converter

Enter "text" or "morse" to convert from text or morse respectively, then enter your string you would like to convert. Check out the morse-code.json file for checking out all the permitted characters. Spaces in the text will be considered as spaces in the morse code too.

## Check out the example below:
*If you enter "text" and then enter:*

SHRIA DEVARAKONDA


*In the output you will recieve:*

Converted string: ...\\....\\.-.\\..\\.-\\ \\-..\\.\\...-\\.-\\.-.\\.-\\-.-\\---\\-.\\-..\\.-


**_Here, the space: ' ' is retained as a space itself. Converting it back is also the same._**


*If you enter "morse" and then enter:*

...\\....\\.-.\\..\\.-\\ \\-..\\.\\...-\\.-\\.-.\\.-\\-.-\\---\\-.\\-..\\.-


*In the output you will recieve:*
